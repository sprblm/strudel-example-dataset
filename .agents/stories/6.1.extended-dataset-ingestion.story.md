# Story 6.1: Extended Dataset Ingestion Integrity

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** data engineer,
**I want** the extended Palmer Penguins dataset ingested accurately,
**so that** the application can expose new categorical findings without losing data fidelity.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `Penguin` type includes `diet`, `life_stage`, and `health_metrics` fields with null-safe handling
2. Year range supports 2021–2025 and matches source data
3. Ingestion pipeline retains all extended fields in `public/data/penguins.json`
4. Category normalization maps variants (e.g., `Torgensen` → `Torgersen`) before filters consume data
5. Data assumptions and transformations documented for QA review

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 5.2 established URL synchronization via `useURLSync`; extended filters must integrate with the same serialization patterns to keep shared links valid. [Source: .agents/stories/5.2.share-filtered-view.story.md]

### Data Models

- Data and filter stores in Zustand share a central `Penguin` model; any type updates must remain compatible with selectors that compute species/island distributions and numeric ranges. [Source: .agents/architecture/state-management.md#store-architecture]

### Data Flow

- Data loading sequence pulls from `public/data/penguins.json`, hydrates stores, and normalizes filter state via memoized selectors; transformations should occur before store hydration to avoid redundant recomputation. [Source: .agents/architecture/data-flow.md#initial-load-sequence]

### State Management

- The data store handles raw dataset storage, error handling, and computed maps; normalization utilities should feed through `loadData` to preserve caching and selector memoization guarantees. [Source: .agents/architecture/state-management.md#data-store-datastorets]

### File Locations

- Dataset and ingestion logic reside under `public/` and `src/hooks/` respectively; normalization helpers belong in `src/utils/` per project structure guidelines. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#project-organization]

### Testing Requirements

- Follow the testing pyramid with Vitest coverage for transformers and helpers, integration checks for store updates, and ensure accessibility/performance budgets remain intact. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#pyramid-distribution]

### Technical Constraints

- Performance budgets require filter interactions <100 ms and chart renders <300 ms; memoization and normalization must scale for ~3k records without breaching these targets. [Source: .agents/architecture/performance.md#performance-requirements]

### Project Structure Notes

- Maintain existing directory conventions and avoid introducing new top-level folders; reuse `utils/dataHelpers.ts` or create adjacent helpers to keep data processing centralized. [Source: .agents/architecture/source-tree.md#utility-organization]

## Project Structure Alignment

- No structural conflicts identified; planned updates align with established hooks, utils, and types locations documented in the architecture.

## Risks / Open Questions

- Normalization coverage tracked in `.agents/qa/assessments/6.1.extended-dataset-transformations-20251018.md`; extend mappings if upstream dataset introduces new aliases beyond `Torgensen` variants.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- Follow Vitest-based unit coverage for transformers and helpers with files under `tests/unit/utils/` and `tests/unit/hooks/`. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-locations]
- Add integration verification for store updates within `tests/integration/filters/` or equivalent suites to confirm normalized data flows. [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#pyramid-distribution]
- Ensure accessibility/performance automation remains green after ingestion changes by running the existing CI scripts (`npm run style:all`, Cypress smoke where applicable). [Source: .agents/architecture/testing-strategy.md#validation-requirements]

### Completion Notes

- Extended `Penguin` contracts with enumerated diets, life stages, health metrics, and year guardrails, keeping raw feed nullable-safe.
- Reworked ingestion transform with categorical normalizers, sex sanitization, and warning registry; filtered out invalid records.
- Added reusable normalization helpers plus QA summary accessors with targeted Vitest coverage and URL parsing alignment.
- Authored QA note `.agents/qa/assessments/6.1.extended-dataset-transformations-20251018.md` detailing assumptions and spot checks.
- Benchmarked ingestion: `transformPenguinData` averaged **0.913 ms** per run (~1,095 ops/sec) over 548 samples via `vitest bench`.
- Hardened accessibility integration suite with lightweight mocks for router-dependent components; eliminated prior act() warnings by switching tests to user-level tabbing.
- Updated year normalization to preserve future dataset values (no longer coerces to 2025) while still logging drift warnings for QA visibility.
- No additional ingestion tasks pending; next phase will focus on the downstream UI controls (Story 6.2).

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Requirements Traceability

- **AC1** – _Given_ the extended dataset contains diet, life*stage, and health_metrics fields, \_when* `transformPenguinData` runs, _then_ the resulting `Penguin` objects still expose those attributes with null-safe unions; validated by `src/hooks/__tests__/usePenguinData.test.tsx`.
- **AC2** – _Given_ years spanning 2021–2025, _when_ year normalization executes, _then_ valid years persist and out-of-range values trigger `console.warn`; verified via `normalizeYearValue` coverage in `src/utils/__tests__/dataHelpers.test.ts` and benchmark confirming ingestion performance below 1 ms.
- **AC3** – _Given_ the raw JSON feed, _when_ the ingestion hook hydrates data, _then_ no extended attributes are dropped; evidenced by the hook unit test verifying both array entries retain the new fields.
- **AC4** – _Given_ island aliases such as “Torgensen”, _when_ normalization runs, _then_ values are converted to canonical forms before filters use them; covered by `normalizeIslandValue` test cases.
- **AC5** – _Given_ QA needs documented assumptions, _when_ the ingestion completes, _then_ `.agents/qa/assessments/6.1.extended-dataset-transformations-20251018.md` documents mappings, spot-checks, and the new performance snapshot.

### Code Quality Assessment

The ingestion refactor centralizes categorical normalization and sanitizes numeric/sex fields before stores hydrate, which keeps downstream selectors stable. Enumerated literal unions in `src/types/penguin.ts` tighten compiler guarantees and reduce drift between filters and ingestion. The new helper warnings (`getUnexpectedCategorySummary`) offer lightweight observability for dataset drift, and unit coverage exercises key transformation paths. One adaptive risk remains: `normalizeYearValue` clamps any year outside 2021–2025 to `2025`, which would mislabel future records instead of surfacing the new value; that behaviour should be revisited before ingesting 2026+ data.

### Refactoring Performed

- None – analysis only; implementation left intact pending product decision on year-range handling.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ – Follows project TypeScript/MUI patterns, null-safety documented inline.
- Project Structure: ✓ – Changes confined to approved `hooks`, `utils`, `types`, and QA directories.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ – Added unit coverage around transformation and normalization, plus kept integration suite green.
- All ACs Met: ✓ – Functional behaviour and documentation satisfy stated acceptance criteria.

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Derive year bounds dynamically (or persist out-of-range values) instead of coercing everything above 2025 to 2025 so future datasets remain accurate.
- [ ] Expand unit coverage for `normalizeSpeciesValue`/`normalizeDietValue` to exercise the unexpected-category warning summary.
- [x] Recorded ingestion performance benchmark for QA.

### Security Review

No new security surface: transformations run on static dataset assets, no user input. Logging of unexpected categories is development-only and does not emit sensitive data.

### Review Date: 2025-10-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

#### Requirements Traceability

- **AC1** – `transformPenguinData` persists `diet`, `life_stage`, and `health_metrics` through to the typed model; validated via `src/hooks/__tests__/usePenguinData.test.tsx`.
- **AC2** – Extended year span (2021–2025) loads without coercion; `normalizeYearValue` retains in-range years and warns on drift, covered in `src/utils/__tests__/dataHelpers.test.ts`.
- **AC3** – JSON payload (`public/data/penguins.json`) includes extended fields that flow through hydration (manually spot-checked first few records).
- **AC4** – Alias normalization exercised in `urlHelpers` and `dataHelpers` unit suites; filters receive canonical islands.
- **AC5** – Documentation note `.agents/qa/assessments/6.1.extended-dataset-transformations-20251018.md` still states years are coerced to 2025, which is now inaccurate; AC unmet pending doc update.

#### Code & Test Quality Notes

- Transform pipeline now centralises null handling and warning capture; benchmarks in `tests/performance/ingestion.bench.ts` keep ingestion <1 ms, so performance budgets are respected.
- Test coverage spans ingestion hook, helpers, URL parsing, and error paths; recommend adding assertions for unexpected diet/health values when new data arrives.

#### Issues & Recommendations

- **DOC-001 (medium)** – Update `.agents/qa/assessments/6.1.extended-dataset-transformations-20251018.md` to match the current behaviour (no clamping to 2025) and note warning-based drift detection.

#### NFR & Testability

- Security, reliability, and maintainability unaffected (data remains static assets).
- Observability improved via warning registry, though the doc mismatch could mislead future QA.

#### Recommendation

- Status Recommendation: **Changes Required** until documentation reflects the implemented behaviour.

### Review Date: 2025-10-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Requirements Traceability

- **AC1** – Extended fields (`diet`, `life_stage`, `health_metrics`) persist through `transformPenguinData`; validated via `src/hooks/__tests__/usePenguinData.test.tsx` and manual inspection of mocked ingestion output.
- **AC2** – `normalizeYearValue` accepts 2021–2025 without coercion and warns on drift (unit coverage in `src/utils/__tests__/dataHelpers.test.ts`); dataset scan confirmed source years remain within range.
- **AC3** – Spot checks of `public/data/penguins.json` combined with the ingestion hook test confirm no extended attributes are dropped.
- **AC4** – Island aliases normalise to canonical forms through `normalizeIslandValue`; URL helper tests ensure filters consume canonical values.
- **AC5** – Documentation `.agents/qa/assessments/6.1.extended-dataset-transformations-20251018.md` still states out-of-range years are coerced to 2025, which no longer matches implementation → unmet.

### Code & Test Quality Notes

- `normalizeYearValue` now returns the detected year while flagging drift, keeping future datasets observable without silently mutating values.
- Category normalisers share one utility path with guarded logging; unit coverage exercises warning capture and summary reporting.
- Integration keyboard navigation spec mocks the hook with the extended fields, proving downstream consumers tolerate the expanded shape.
- Did not rerun the full Vitest suite during this audit; relied on targeted unit coverage and dataset inspection for verification.

### Issues & Recommendations

- **DOC-001 (medium, persists)** – QA reference note still describes coercing years above 2025; update the document to reflect current warning-only behaviour and include guidance on validating new year values.

### NFR & Testability

- Security: PASS – Transform still operates on static assets only.
- Performance: PASS – Existing bench (~0.9 ms per run) remains valid with unchanged algorithmic complexity.
- Reliability: PASS – Unexpected categories surface via warnings/Summary without data loss apart from intentionally dropped null species/island records.
- Maintainability: CONCERNS – Documentation mismatch risks future QA confusion.

### Recommendation

- Status Recommendation: **Changes Required** until the QA transformation note is corrected.

### Review Date: 2025-10-27 (Follow-up)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Requirements Traceability

- **AC1** – No change; existing unit coverage continues to verify extended fields surface post-transform.
- **AC2** – `normalizeYearValue` retains in-range values and warns on drift; behaviour reconfirmed via unit expectations and direct inspection.
- **AC3** – Manual sampling of `public/data/penguins.json` confirms extended attributes persist end-to-end.
- **AC4** – Canonical island mapping remains validated through `normalizeIslandValue` usage in URL helpers.
- **AC5** – Documentation updated (`.agents/qa/assessments/6.1.extended-dataset-transformations-20251018.md:14`) to describe warning-only handling; acceptance criterion now satisfied.

### Code & Test Quality Notes

- Added regression guardrail `tests/regression/dataset-year-range.test.ts` to keep dataset years, type constants, and QA note in sync; executed via `npx vitest tests/regression/dataset-year-range.test.ts`.
- No other code changes since earlier audit.

### Issues & Recommendations

- No open issues; prior DOC-001 resolved by doc update. Recommend adding regression check in future if dataset year range expands.

### NFR & Testability

- Security: PASS – Unchanged.
- Performance: PASS – Benchmark remains applicable.
- Reliability: PASS – Warning mechanism continues to surface drift.
- Maintainability: PASS – Documentation now reflects actual behaviour.

### Recommendation

- Status Recommendation: **Ready for Done**.
