status_reason: 'Port hand-off works, but the headless Cypress command still aborts unless a dev server is launched manually; automation needs an embedded server step or documented prerequisite.'

    description: '`npm run cy:test` exits with SIGABRT without a running dev/preview server; add automated server orchestration (e.g., start-server-and-test) or document the prerequisite.'

    notes: 'No new transport/security surface; client-only state changes.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Advanced filters reuse memoized selectors; no hot-path regressions noted.'
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'E2E command requires a manually launched dev server; CI flow would be brittle without orchestration.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Cypress specs align with updated components; .temp ignored and cleaned up.'
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: 'Augment `npm run cy:test` to boot the dev server automatically (e.g., start-server-and-test) or update docs/build pipeline accordingly.'
      refs: ['package.json', 'README.md']
  future:
    - action: 'Add a preflight check that fails fast with a clear message when the dev-server port file is absent.'
